	My family and I moved to Atlanta from New York in 1986 when my son was only 6 months old to be closer to our extended family here in Georgia as well as in Tennessee and North Carolina.
Since then we have built a comfortable life in the suburbs of Atlanta. We are all very close and still live within 30 minutes of each other.</p>
