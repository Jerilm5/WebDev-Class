	<h2> Highlighting text</h2>
	
	<p>So, I went back and read the instructions myself to see what I'd done wrong. They said:</p>
 <blockquote>
     <p>Remove the tray from the box. Pierce the overwrap several times with a fork and cook on High for <mark>15 minutes</mark>, rotating it half way through.</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>I thought he'd told me <em>fifty</em>. No wonder it exploded in my microwave.</p>
 
<br>

<p>It's usually bad practice to use a class name that explicitly describes how an element should look, such as the highlighted portion of CSS below:</p>
 <pre>
     <code>
        <mark>.greenText</mark> {
           color: green;
        }
     </code>
</pre>
