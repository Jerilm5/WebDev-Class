<h1>Antoni Gaudi</h1>
<p>Many tourists are drawn to Barcelona to see Antoni Gaudi's incredible architecture.</p>

<p>Barcelona celebrated the 150th anniversery of Gaudi's birth in 2002</p>

<h2 lang="es">La Casa Milla</h2>
<p> Gaudi's work was essentially useful. <span lang="es">La Casa Milla</span> is an apartment building and real people live there</p>

<h2 lang="es">La Sagrada Familia</h2>
<p>The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona.</p>
