<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3> Email Address: <a href="mailto:jeryl.lynn.miles@live.mercer.edu">jeryl.lynn.miles@live.mercer.edu</a></h3>
<p>Hi and welcome to my page. My name is Jeri and I am pursuing a BS in Software Development & Human Computer Interaction here at <a href="https://www.mercer.edu/" target="external" title="Mercer University"> Mercer University</a>. I am taking this class as part of my required curriculum.
I am not an expert at any programming language. I know enough of SQL, Java, and C++ to be <em>dangerous</em> but not exactly productive. I use SQL pretty much daily for database queries I run for my monthly reporting requirements at work.
Last semester I created a wireframe for a mobile app using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator but I am not an expert in either. I have minimal web development experience. I have created websites using Wix and WordPress and have tried my hand at development utilizing online courses from Free Code Camp and Udemy.
I work on the fringes of IT as a Sr Assoc Digital Product Manager. I am responsible for the UX/UI of the end user however, I am not a developer nor do I manage a development team. I am more like the PMO than PO. I expect to finish this class with marketable skills in web development. I would like to learn the fundamentals of web development and design at the end of these 8 weeks. I look forward to working together and hope to have great dialogue and knowledge sharing with you all. </p>
