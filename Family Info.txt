My family and I moved to Atlanta from New york in 1986 when my son was only 6 months old.  Since then we have built a comfortable life here. We are all very close and still live within 30 minutes of each other.

My mom (Mommy and Gran) will be 79 years old this year and we will celebrate her as we always do at herchosen restaurant with a special cake.

My sister (pic taken in London) is my travel companion and we try to travel together when ever the opportunity presents itself as our scheduled do not always sync.

My son is my best friend we are very much alike and both pocess the drive to succeed.  He is a veteran of Iraq war, an entrepreneur and a student like me.

Odie runs my household, he takes his job of protecting my mom and myself very seriously and no one can enter our house with going through him first.
